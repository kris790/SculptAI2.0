# V-Taper Pro 🏆

**The Elite Physique Competition Prep Platform**

V-Taper Pro is a specialized fitness ecosystem designed for bodybuilders and physique competitors. Unlike generic fitness apps, V-Taper Pro focuses on the mathematical precision of aesthetic development, primarily targeting the **1.5:1 shoulder-to-waist "Golden Ratio"**.

## 🚀 Core Innovation: Physique Ratio Analytics

The platform moves beyond simple weight tracking by quantifying aesthetic progress:
- **V-Taper Ratio Tracking**: Real-time calculation of shoulder-to-waist proportions.
- **Comp Prep Phases**: Specialized logic for "Muscle Building," "The Cut," and "Peak Week."
- **AI-Powered Coaching**: Personalized insights generated by Google Gemini to optimize frame width and midsection tightness.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Aesthetic HQ (Dashboard)**: High-impact visualization of competition countdowns, current phase targets, and primary physique metrics.
- **Precision Progress Tracking**: Detailed measurement logging with support for both Imperial and Metric units, visualized via Recharts.
- **Guided Aesthetic Training**: High-performance workout engine pre-loaded with foundations for deltoid width and lat thickness.
- **Network & Social**: An athlete spotlight system and "Buddy Finder" to connect with other competitors in the same prep phase.
- **Coach Marketplace**: Direct access to verified IFBB/NPC professional coaches for personalized prep protocols.
